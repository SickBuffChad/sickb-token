# Sick Buffalo DAO (SICKB) — White Paper V. 1.0
## 1. Introduction
Sick Buffalo ($SICKB) is an Ethereum-native token born from meme culture but built for utility, governance, and long-term execution. It began as a joke referencing Thai internet scams—“my girlfriend’s buffalo is sick”—but has since evolved into a serious, zero-tax, community-driven project.
No stealth launches. No VC allocations. No hype cycles. Just a token that does what it says.
Originally launched on a now-defunct Layer 2 chain (PEPU), Sick Buffalo migrated to Ethereum after PEPU’s infrastructure proved unstable. The migration preserved the project’s ethos and allowed development to continue on a more secure and transparent blockchain.
$SICKB is now live on Ethereum mainnet, with a Pinksale presale underway at[sickb.sale](https://sickb.sale).
But this isn’t a nostalgia project. $SICKB is designed to:
- 
Power DAO governance

- 
Access internal tools and products

- 
Reward contributors and community members over time

- 
Connect crypto to real-world assets and experiences


It’s the core asset of a project that’s serious about giving meme tokens long-term structure—and giving holders a real stake in what comes next.

## 3. Sick Premier League (SPL) — On-Chain Trading Competition
The SickB Premier League (SPL) is a competitive trading league built into the SICKB ecosystem. It gamifies on-chain activity through:
- 
Weekly wallet performance tracking

- 
Division-based rankings (Premier League, Division 2)

- 
Real-time scoring based on volume, PnL, activity


Season Format:
- 
📊 Weekly snapshots, live dashboard (sickb.io)

- 
🧠 Metrics include Buys, Sells, PnL, and holding duration

- 
🏅 Rewards in $SICKB, NFTs, Discord roles


Status: SPL was live tested on PEPU and is scheduled to relaunch with improved tools on Ethereum, including:
- 
NFT badge drops

- 
Smart contract score logging

- 
DAO-approved prize pools


## 4. Sidechain & Bridge Strategy
After PEPU collapsed, the Sick Buffalo team paused all bridge development and transitioned to a resilient L1-first approach. Previous work included:
- 
Lock & Mint ERC-20 bridge functions

- 
Manual mint/burn logic on both chains

- 
Bridge feasibility testing (Remix, Hardhat)


Findings:
- 
PEPU lacked true L2-to-L1 communication

- 
Future bridge development will focus on Ethereum <> Arbitrum, Base, or Optimism

- 
All future bridging contracts will be modular and DAO-controlled


Sidechain deployments remain a long-term target for:
- 
Staking rewards

- 
RWA hosting

- 
Gas fee optimization


## 5. DAO Governance Structure
The Sick Buffalo DAO operates through a hybrid model of community votes and council oversight.
### Governance Council (SBGC)
- 
1 permanent founder seat (Josh)

- 
4 elected token holder seats

Annual elections, .25% token minimum to run

- 
Max 2 terms per council member


### Voting Power
- 
1 vote per 10 $SICKB held

- 
Bonus votes for staking or NFT ownership (optional)

- 
Snapshot and multisig control for proposal enforcement


### Community Overrides
- 
60% quorum override rule for major decisions


### Treasury Control
- 
Treasury held in multisig wallet

- 
All funds distributed based on DAO-approved proposals


## 6. Real-World Utility & Sick Buffalo Bar

Discounts on drinks, merch, and events

- 
Exclusive party access

## 8. SaaS Tools, Automation & Bots
Several tools are in development:

Telegram AI Bots (ChadBot, KittyBot)

- 
NFT dashboards and contract utilities


Some tools may require:
- 
Locked $SICKB

- 
Diamond NFT ownership

- 
DAO proposal approval for external use


## 9. Grants, Partnerships & Community Bounties
Builders can propose:
- 
Tools, bots, dashboards

-

- 
Proposal → Council review → Vote → Multisig release

Ongoing public bounty board


## 10. Security & Auditing Commitments
All code is tested before public use. We prefer audited, known-good open-source contracts when possible.
- 
Internal testing precedes any release

- 
Public test phases (like SPL Season 1) are labeled

- 
Audits will be done before major deployments

- 
DAO can fund bug bounty campaigns as needed


## Conclusion
Sick Buffalo is more than a meme—it’s a serious, self-funded effort to build real utility around a community-first token. We’ve moved away from unreliable infrastructure and embraced Ethereum Layer 1 to bring structure, trust, and long-term possibilities to a space often dominated by hype.
$SICKB holders aren't just investors—they’re contributors, governors, and beneficiaries of a growing suite of tools, products, and real-world ventures. From governance and NFT access to trading leagues and the Pattaya bar relaunch, everything is built with the community in mind.
The DAO structure, clean tokenomics, and roadmap are designed to evolve with feedback and growth. Whether you’re here to build, participate, or just hold the line—you’re part of the herd.
We’re not here to follow the trend. We’re here to build the brand.
